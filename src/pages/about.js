    <h2>My name is VocabBuilderApp and I can help you learn.</h2>

    <p>
      I provide a way test yourself against a list of words and definitions that
      you create. Say you are reading a book and come across a word that you
      don’t know. Simply put it on a list. At some point, fill in the
      definition. Soon, you’ll have a pragmatic list of vocab words that you can
      quiz yourself on. Goodbye preset vocab lists of words you’ve never even
      heard. Hello improved vocabulary!
    </p>

    <p>
      The quiz works as follows. I randomly select from your carefully curated
      list of words, the challenge is on. Look at the word, think of the
      definition. Check yourself by showing the definition. If you nailed it,
      click correct and I won’t choose that word again for this quiz. If you
      stumbled, the word goes back in the pile.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a very effective way to learn a list of words. I'm just like
      flashcards, but always with you. Carrying a stack of flashcards is so
      1999.
